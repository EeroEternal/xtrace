description: Add a new SQL migration under migrations/ so sqlx embeds it and xtrace applies it on startup. Use when creating migrations/NNN_*.sql, debugging "migration not applied", or touching sqlx::migrate!.

# Add a SQL migration (sqlx compile-time embed)

## Symptom / misjudgment
You add `migrations/NNN_*.sql`, run `cargo build`, start xtrace, and the new version never appears in `_sqlx_migrations`. It looks like the SQL is wrong; the real cause is cargo not rebuilding after a **new file** under `migrations/`.

## Root cause
`sqlx::migrate!("./migrations")` embeds migration files at **compile time**. Cargo does not treat a newly added file in that directory as a reason to rebuild the crate that embeds it.

## Procedure
1. Create `migrations/NNN_<short_snake_name>.sql` with the next unused version prefix.
2. **Force rebuild**: `touch src/app.rs` (or any file under `src/` that participates in the binary), then `cargo build --bin xtrace`.
3. Start xtrace with a valid `DATABASE_URL`; migrations run on startup.
4. Confirm: `\dt` / query `_sqlx_migrations` shows the new `version`, or logs show it applied.

## Editing an existing migration
- Changing an already-applied file triggers sqlx checksum checks.
- `src/db/pool.rs` has a local repair path; for a clean re-run locally you may `DELETE FROM _sqlx_migrations WHERE version = <N>;` then restart (dev only).
- Do not rewrite applied migrations on shared/prod DBs — add a new forward migration instead.

## Verification
- After touch + build + start, `_sqlx_migrations` contains the new version.
- Do not conclude "SQL bug" until this rebuild step was done.
